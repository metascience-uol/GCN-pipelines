# CGN_pipelines

Quantifying similarities between fMRI processing pipelines for efficient multiverse analysis

## Installation

We recommend using a dedicated Python environment (e.g. through conda) to mitigate the risk of potential version conflicts:
```
conda create -n gcn-piplines python==3.8.0
conda activate gcn-piplines
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

- The main script which reproduces the results from the paper is located in `main.ipynb`
- The multiverse analysis is located in `mverse.py`
